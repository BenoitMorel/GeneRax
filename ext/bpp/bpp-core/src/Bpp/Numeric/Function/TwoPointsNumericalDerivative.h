 * @brief Two points numerical derivative function wrapper.
 *
 * Numerical derivatives use two points to compute the (first order) derivatives.
 * @f$x_0@f$ is the focus point and @f$x_{+1} = x_0+h@f$ (or @f$x_0-h@f$, if constrained on the right).
 * Corresponding function values are @f$f_0@f$, @f$f_{-1}@f$ and @f$f_{+1/-1}@f$ respectively.
 * The derivatives are then computed using the central formulas:
 * @f{eqnarray*}
 * \dfrac{\partial   f}{\partial x  } &=& \dfrac{f_{+1}-f_{0}}{h}\mathrm{\ or}\\
 * \dfrac{\partial   f}{\partial x  } &=& \dfrac{f_{0}-f_{-1}}{h}\\
 * @f}
 * This class does not allow computation of second order derivatives.
 *
 * The @f$h@f$ parameter is computed in a parameter dependent manner:
 * @f$ h = x \times e@f$, with @f$x \neq 0@f$ being the current parameter value.
 * If @f$x = 0@f$, @f$h = e@f$.
 * Default value is provided for @f$e@f$ and corresponds to the _h field.
 * The default value works fine in most cases, but you may want to change it using the setInterval method.
