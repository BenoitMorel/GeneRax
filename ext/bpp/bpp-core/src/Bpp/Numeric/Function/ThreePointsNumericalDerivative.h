 * @brief Three points numerical derivative function wrapper.
 *
 * Numerical derivatives use three points to compute the derivatives.
 * @f$x_0@f$ is the focus point, @f$x_{-1} = x_0-h@f$ and @f$x_{+1} = x_0+h@f$
 * are other points, with function values @f$f_0@f$, @f$f_{-1}@f$ and @f$f_{+1}@f$ respectively.
 * The derivatives are then computed using the central formulas:
 * @f{eqnarray*}
 * \dfrac{\partial   f}{\partial x  } &=& \dfrac{f_{+1}-f_{-1}}{2h}\\
 * \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} &=& \dfrac{f_{+1}-2f_0+f_{-1}}{h^2}\\
 * @f}
 * In case of border limit (when @f$x_{-1}@f$ or @f$x_{+1}@f$ are not computable),
 * the foreward and backward computations are performed, respectively:
 * @f{eqnarray*}
 * \dfrac{\partial   f}{\partial x  } &=& \dfrac{f_{+1}-f_0}{h}\\
 * \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} &=& \dfrac{f_{+2}-2f_{+1}+f_0}{h^2}\\
 * @f}
 * and
 * @f{eqnarray*}
 * \dfrac{\partial   f}{\partial x  } &=& \dfrac{f_0-f_{-1}}{h}\\
 * \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} &=& \dfrac{f_0-2f_{-1}+f_{-2}}{h^2}\\
 * @f}
 *
 * The @f$h@f$ parameter is computed in a parameter dependent manner:
 * @f$ h = x \times e@f$, with @f$x \neq 0@f$ being the current parameter value.
 * If @f$x = 0@f$, @f$h = e@f$.
 * Default value is provided for @f$e@f$ and corresponds to the _h field.
 * The default value works fine in most cases, but you may want to change it using the setInterval method.
