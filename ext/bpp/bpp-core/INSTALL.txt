This software needs cmake >= 2.8.11 and a C++11 capable compiler to build

After installing cmake, run it with the following command:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[where to install, for instance /usr/local or $HOME/.local] .

If available, you can also use ccmake instead of cmake for a more user-friendly interface.

Then compile and install the software with:
$ make install

You may also consider installing and using the software checkinstall for easier system administration.

If you install Bio++ in a non standard path (not /usr/), remember that:
-> if you compile your project with CMake, give it the path with -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path>
-> if you compile with something else, give the path to the compiler (-I / -L options)
-> if you use shared libraries, you must also tell programs where to find them at startup:
  -> either by adding the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
  -> or by using RPATHs to hard code the path in the executable (generates NON PORTABLE executables !)
    -> with CMake, see documentation in bpp-core/cmake/project-template
    -> or see your compiler documentation ("-Wl,-rpath,<path>" for clang/gcc)
    -> consider installing Bio++ with the "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=TRUE" option

Detailed documentation for using Bio++ with CMake are available in bpp-core/cmake/
