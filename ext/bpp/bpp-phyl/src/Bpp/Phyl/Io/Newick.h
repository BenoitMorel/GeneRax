  /**
   * @brief The so-called 'newick' parenthetic format.
   *
   * Branch lengths and bootstraps are supported:
   *
   * ex:
   * <code>
   * ((A:0.1, B:0.15)90:0.2, C:0.27);
   * </code>
   *
   * Code example:
   * @code
   * #include <Phyl/Newick.h>
   * #include <Phyl/Tree/Tree.h>
   * 
   * Newick * newickReader = new Newick(false); //No comment allowed!
   * try {
   * 	Tree * tree = newickReader->read("MyTestTree.dnd"); // Tree in file MyTestTree.dnd
   * 	cout << "Tree has " << tree->getNumberOfLeaves() << " leaves." << endl;
   * } catch (Exception e) {
   *	cout << "Error when reading tree." << endl;
   * }
   * delete tree;
   * delete newickReader;
   * @endcode
   *
   * Bootstrap values are stored as node properties, as Number<double> objects and with the tag TreeTools::BOOTSTRAP.
   *
   * This is also possible to read a "tagged" tree, where additional info is provided in place of bootstrap values:
   * ((A,B)N2,(C,D)N3)N1;
   * This is achieved by calling the enableExtendedBootstrapProperty method, and providing a property name to use.
   * The additional information will be stored at each node as a property, in a String object.
   * The disableExtendedBootstrapProperty method restores the default behavior.
