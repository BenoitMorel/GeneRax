/**
 * @brief The so-called 'Nhx - New Hampshire eXtended' parenthetic format. 
 *
 * See http://www.phylosoft.org/Nhx/ for details.
 *
 * Branch lengths and node annotations are supported:
 *
 * ex:
 * <code>
 * ((A:0.1[&&NHX:S=human], B:0.15[&&NHX:S=chimp]):0.2[&&NHX:B=90:D=N:S=primates], C:0.27[&&NHX:S=mouse]);
 * </code>
 *
 * Where e.g. "S=human" means that the sequence A comes from species "human", "B=90" stands for a support value, 
 * and "D=N" means that there was no duplication at the node. Other tags are allowed, see http://www.phylosoft.org/NHX/.
 * By default, comments between "[" and "]" are removed, unless the opening bracket is followed by "&&NHX".
 *
 * Code example:
 * @code
 * #include <Phyl/Nhx.h>
 * #include <Phyl/Tree/Tree.h>
 * 
 * Nhx * NhxReader = new Nhx();
 * try {
 *   Tree * tree = nhxReader->read("MyTestTree.dnd"); // Tree in file MyTestTree.dnd
 *   cout << "Tree has " << tree->getNumberOfLeaves() << " leaves." << endl;
 * } catch (Exception e) {
 *  cout << "Error when reading tree." << endl;
 * }
 * delete tree;
 * delete nhxReader;
 * @endcode
 *
 * All node annotations are stored as node properties, with type bppString for all properties except for support values, where a Number is used.
