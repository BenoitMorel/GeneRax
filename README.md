# GeneRax 

GeneRax is a parallel tool for sequence- and species-aware maximum-likelihood gene tree inference.

GeneRax infers gene trees from their aligned sequences and a rooted undated species tree.

GeneRax accounts for sequence substitutions, gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene transfer.
