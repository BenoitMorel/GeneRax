# GeneRax 

GeneRax is a parallel tool for species tree-aware maximum likelihood based gene tree inference under gene duplication, transfer, and loss.

It infers gene trees from their aligned sequences, the mapping between genes and species, and a rooted undated species tree.

It accounts for sequence substitutions, gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene transfer.
